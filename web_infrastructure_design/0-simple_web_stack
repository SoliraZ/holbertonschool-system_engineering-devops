### **Simple Web Stack Infrastructure Diagram**

**Request Flow:**
1. User enters `www.foobar.com` in their browser.
2. DNS resolves `www.foobar.com` to `8.8.8.8` (the server's IP).
3. The browser sends an HTTP/HTTPS request to `8.8.8.8`.
4. Nginx (web server) receives the request and serves static files or forwards dynamic requests to the application server.
5. The application server processes the request, interacts with the MySQL database if needed, and generates a response.
6. Nginx sends the response back to the user's browser.

### **Explanation of Components**

1. **What is a server?**  
   A server is a physical or virtual computer that provides resources, services, or data to other computers (clients) over a network. In this setup, the server hosts all the components needed for the website to function: the web server, application server, and database.

2. **What is the role of the domain name?**  
   The domain name (`foobar.com`) acts as a human-friendly address for the website. Instead of remembering the server's IP address (`8.8.8.8`), users type `www.foobar.com`, and DNS translates it to the correct IP so browsers can connect to the server.

3. **What type of DNS record is `www` in `www.foobar.com`?**  
   The `www` in `www.foobar.com` is typically a **CNAME record** (Canonical Name record) that points to `foobar.com`, which itself has an **A record** mapping to the server's IP (`8.8.8.8`). Sometimes, `www` can be an **A record** directly, but CNAME is common for subdomains.

4. **What is the role of the web server?**  
   The web server (Nginx) listens for HTTP/HTTPS requests from users. It serves static files (like images, CSS, JS) directly and forwards requests for dynamic content to the application server.

5. **What is the role of the application server?**  
   The application server runs the website's backend code (such as PHP, Python, or Node.js). It processes user requests, applies business logic, and communicates with the database to fetch or store data as needed.

6. **What is the role of the database?**  
   The database (MySQL) stores all persistent data for the website, such as user accounts, posts, and transactions. The application server queries or updates this data as part of handling user requests.

7. **What is the server using to communicate with the user's computer?**  
   The server communicates with the user's computer using the **HTTP or HTTPS protocol** over the internet, allowing browsers to send requests and receive responses.

### **Issues with This Infrastructure**

- **Single Point of Failure (SPOF):** If the server fails, the entire website becomes unavailable.
- **Downtime for Maintenance:** Any updates or restarts (e.g., deploying new code, server upgrades) cause the site to be temporarily unavailable.
- **Scalability Limitations:** The server can only handle a limited amount of traffic. If too many users visit at once, performance will degrade or the site may go down.
